# New Line Checker

This checker verifies:

- That common text files end in a single new line character.
- Only \n (line feed) is used for new lines, not \r (carriage return).

## Fixes

This checker supports fixing box the above issues at a file level (it cannot selectively fix only
a subset of these issues).
